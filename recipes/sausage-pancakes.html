        <p>This quick and simple recipe will make tasty sausage pancakes for 4.</p>
        <p>Prep time is 5 minutes and cook time is 10 minutes for a total of 15 minutes</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 cups complete pancake mix</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups water, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>8 pre-cooked sausage patties</li>
            <li>syrup for dipping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol id="steps">
            <li>Combine pancake mix and water in a bowl and stir until just blended 
                (there may be a few lumps).</li>
            <li>Heat half of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat 
                until melted.</li>
            <li>Dip half of the sausage patties in the batter until evenly coated and 
                place in the skillet.  Cook undisturbed until lightly browned and 
                slightly puffed, 2 to 3 minutes.  Flip and cook until the pancake is 
                cooked through, 2 to 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining batter and sausage. Serve with syrup if desired 
                for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
